# Background Music Setup

## Instructions

To add background music to your website, place your audio file in this directory with the name `background-music.mp3`.

### Supported formats:
- MP3 (recommended for best browser compatibility)
- OGG (for Firefox support)
- WAV (uncompressed, larger file size)

### Recommended audio file properties:
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes (it will loop automatically)
- **Volume**: Soft/quiet music (the component sets volume to 30% by default)
- **File size**: Keep under 5MB for faster loading
- **Genre**: Ambient, instrumental, or classical music works best for background

### Where to find royalty-free music:
- Freesound.org
- YouTube Audio Library
- Pixabay Music
- Incompetech.com
- Zapsplat (requires free account)

### File naming:
- Primary file: `background-music.mp3`
- Optional alternatives:
  - `background-music.ogg`
  - `background-music.wav`

### How it works:
1. When users visit your website, they'll see a prompt asking if they want to play background music
2. If they choose "Yes", the music will start playing and loop continuously
3. Users can pause/play the music using the floating button in the bottom-right corner
4. The music will respect browser autoplay policies (requires user interaction first)
